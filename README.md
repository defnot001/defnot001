### Thank you for checking out my profile page! ðŸ‘‹

I recently started learning about web development topics and finished some basic courses on Codecademy. I use this profile to document my journey and hopefully also contriute towards OS projects. Until then, this is what I am up to at the moment: 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Typescript and other web dev related topics.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m mainly working on my two Discord bots.
