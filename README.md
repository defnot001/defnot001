### Thank you for checking out my profile page! ðŸ‘‹

I recently started learning about web development topics and finished some basic courses on codecademy. I use this profile to document my journey and hopefully also contriute towards open source projects. Until then, this is what I am up to at the moment: 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Typescript and generally Web Developement.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m mainly working on my two discord bots.
